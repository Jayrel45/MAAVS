Movie Aquisition and Voting System (MAAVS)
People submit movie suggestions using a 'suggest command' in a discord text channel
the bot then adds this suggestion to a master list of movie suggestions

When the bot wrangler is ready they can invoke a "vote command"

The bot randomly selects as many movies as the server wants

The bot then has these selection listed to be voted on through message reactions

the bot reads the reactions then displays the winner of the vote and it is removed from the master list
